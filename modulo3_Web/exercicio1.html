        <h1>Jeff Bezos and the everything store</h1>

        <p>
            Amazon.com's visionary founder, Jeff Bezos, wasn't content with being a bookseller.
             He wanted Amazon to become the everything store, <em>offering limitless selection and seductive convenience at disruptively low prices.</em>
              To do so, he developed a corporate culture of relentless ambition and secrecy that's never been cracked. Until now.
        </p>

             Brad Stone enjoyed unprecedented access to current and former Amazon employees and Bezos family members, 
             and his book is the first in-depth,
             fly-on-the-wall account of life at Amazon. The Everything Store is the book that 
             the business world can't stop talking about, the revealing, 
             definitive biography of the company that placed one of the first and largest bets 
             on the Internet and forever changed the way we <strong>shop</strong> and read.
